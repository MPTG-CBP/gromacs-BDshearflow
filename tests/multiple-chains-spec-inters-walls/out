Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /home/camilo/workspace/gromacs/gromacs-BDshearflow/tests/multiple-chains-spec-inters-walls
Command line:
  gmx insert-molecules -ci tmp1.gro -nmol 200 -o tmp-box.gro -radius 3.2 -try 100 -box 800 800 800

Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx insert-molecules uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.
