; four bead types:
; B1: polymer bead: non-specific interactions.
; B2: polymer bead: for specific polymer-polymer interactions (e.g. A1-A2). 
; B3: polymer bead: for specific polymer-wall interaction (if wanted)
; BW: wall bead
; Any new specific interaction can be included by adding new beads

; mass here is ~of A1 domain but it does not matter for BD sims.


; For specific interactions, both the repeling and the attractive part of the LJ potential is considered, within a cutoff of 7 nm (controlled in the mdp file)

; For non-spec interactions, only the repeling part of the LJ potential is considered. In order to only have the repelling part within the cutoff of 7 nm, sigma is set such that  7 nm = sigma*2^(1/6). To achieve a slowly-increasing potential towards values off ~3.2 nm, a low epsilon value is chosen.
